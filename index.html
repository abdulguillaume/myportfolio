  <h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am Guillaume Abdul, I am <em>Haitian</em> and I live in the U.S. since Sept 2016.
I see myself as a a very self motivated person and a quick learner.
I do go to the gym at least three times a week, also I try to learn something new on weekly basis.
I am trying to keep both my body and my mind in good health.
In my free time, I do play some backetball and also I do go to the movie theater to see a good action movie to spike my adrenaline.
By the way, which I.T. guy doesn't love THE MATRIX? &#128522;

  <h1>Why I Decided to Learn Programming</h1>
<p>
I am the kind of person who get bored easily and for me, to keep my mind busy, I am always up to the challenge of working on something new, doing problem solving, trying to troubleshoot any complex issues etc.
I feel in peace with myself while doing and learning programming, because of its perpetual evolution.
You never stop learning, so no time to get bored.
